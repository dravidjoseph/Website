				<td>Paradigm Name</td>
				<td>Parent Paradigm</td>
				<td>Explanation</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Imperative</td>
				<td>N/A</td>
				<td>Explicitly describes actions of a program.  Uses sequences of statements to modify program state.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Declarative</td>
				<td>N/A</td>
				<td>Programs describe what they want, not how to get what they want.  Tend to lack side-effects.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Structured</td>
				<td>Imperative/Declarative</td>
				<td>Statements that are imperative/declarative.  Get's rid of GOTOs.  Uses for loops or if statements.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Procedural</td>
				<td>Imperative/Structured</td>
				<td>Based on procedures (functions) which can be called from anywhere in the code.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Functional</td>
				<td>Structured/Declarative</td>
				<td> Highly similar to procedural, but doesn't possess state so more like declarative.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Object-Oriented</td>
				<td>Imperative</td>
				<td>Data structures form objects, which contain methods and attributes.  They are created/instantiated from classes, and are treated as nont structured.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Logic</td>
				<td>Declarative</td>
				<td>Engine answers questions based on facts and rules.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
